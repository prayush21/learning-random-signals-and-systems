# Gemini Learning Plan: Random Signals and Systems

This document outlines the learning objectives, guiding principles, and project-based curriculum for our study of Random Signals and Systems.

## 1. Learner Interests & Objectives

The user is a person of **science, math, product, and content**. The primary objective is to gain a deep, practical understanding of the concepts and be able to engineer solutions using them. The learning should be fun, engaging, and focused on building tangible projects in the domains of **software, product, AI, and content/stories**.

## 2. Guiding Principles

*   **Go Beyond the Syllabus:** I (Gemini) have the liberty to introduce supplementary material, correct potential errors in the provided content, and use my own judgment to ensure the user achieves a thorough understanding of concepts, logic, and engineering application.
*   **Emphasis on Visualization:** We will strive to visualize all abstract concepts (e.g., probability distributions, signals, processes) using Python libraries to make them more intuitive.
*   **"What-If" Scenarios:** We will approach each project like a product manager, asking "What if..." questions to explore the boundaries of our solutions and connect theory to practical problem-solving.
*   **Project-Driven Learning:** Every module will culminate in a practical coding project that reinforces the theoretical concepts.
*   **Active Learning with Boilerplate:** For coding exercises, I will provide boilerplate code (including function signatures, comments, and test cases). The user will then implement the core logic, reinforcing concepts through hands-on practice.

## 3. Project Roadmap

*   **Module 1 (Probability Basics): Naive Bayes Spam Classifier.**
    *   **Goal:** Build a functional spam filter from scratch.
    *   **Concepts:** Conditional probability, Bayes' theorem, sample spaces.

*   **Module 2 (Discrete Random Variables): Call Center Queue Simulator.**
    *   **Goal:** Model and simulate a call center to analyze wait times and resource allocation.
    *   **Concepts:** Poisson, Binomial, and Geometric distributions.

*   **Module 3 (Continuous Random Variables): Procedural Content Generator.**
    *   **Goal:** Use continuous distributions to procedurally generate a 2D map for a game or story.
    *   **Concepts:** Normal, Uniform, and Exponential distributions.

*   **Module 4 (Joint Random Variables): Stock Portfolio Risk Visualizer.**
    *   **Goal:** Simulate two correlated stocks to visualize their joint movement and understand basic financial risk.
    *   **Concepts:** Jointly distributed random variables, correlation, covariance.

*   **Module 5 (Random Processes): Markov Chain Text Generator.**
    *   **Goal:** Train a model on a text corpus to generate new, stylistically similar text.
    *   **Concepts:** Random processes, Markov chains, state transitions.
